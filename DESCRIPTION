Description: qsea (quantitative sequencing enrichment analysis) was developed 
    as the successor of the MEDIPS package for analyzing data derived from 
    methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) experiments followed by 
    sequencing (MeDIP-seq). However, qsea provides several functionalities for 
    the analysis of other kinds of quantitative sequencing data 
    (e.g. ChIP-seq, MBD-seq, CMS-seq and others) 
    including calculation of differential enrichment between groups of samples.
