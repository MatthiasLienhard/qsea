    followed by sequencing (MeDIP-seq) has become a major tool for epigenetic
    studies in health and disease. The computational analysis of such
    data, however, still falls short on accuracy, sensitivity, and speed.
    We propose a time-efficient statistical method that is able to cope
    with the inherent complexity of MeDIP-seq data with similar performance
    compared with existing methods. In order to demonstrate the computational
    approach, we have analyzed alterations in DNA methylation during
    the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to definitive
    endoderm. We show improved correlation of normalized MeDIP-seq data
    in comparison to available whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data,
    and investigated the effect of differential methylation on gene expression.
    Furthermore, we analyzed the interplay between DNA methylation, histone
    modifications, and transcription factor binding and show that in
    contrast to de novo methylation, demethylation is mainly associated
    with regions of low CpG densities.},

  abstract = {DNA methylation is an indispensible epigenetic modification required
    for regulating the expression of mammalian genomes. Immunoprecipitation-based
    methods for DNA methylome analysis are rapidly shifting the bottleneck
    in this field from data generation to data analysis, necessitating
    the development of better analytical tools. In particular, an inability
    to estimate absolute methylation levels remains a major analytical
    difficulty associated with immunoprecipitation-based DNA methylation
    profiling. To address this issue, we developed a cross-platform algorithm-Bayesian
    tool for methylation analysis (Batman)-for analyzing methylated DNA
    immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) profiles generated using oligonucleotide
    arrays (MeDIP-chip) or next-generation sequencing (MeDIP-seq). We
    developed the latter approach to provide a high-resolution whole-genome
    DNA methylation profile (DNA methylome) of a mammalian genome. Strong
    correlation of our data, obtained using mature human spermatozoa,
    with those obtained using bisulfite sequencing suggest that combining
    MeDIP-seq or MeDIP-chip with Batman provides a robust, quantitative
    and cost-effective functional genomic strategy for elucidating the

    1.9 million CpG methylation values derived from 12 different tissues.
    Analysis of six annotation categories showed that evolutionarily

    start site is an informative surrogate for promoter methylation.
    We find that 17\% of the 873 analyzed genes are differentially methylated

    5' UTRs are inversely correlated with transcription. Despite the
    fact that our study controlled for factors reported to affect DNA

  abstract = {DNA cytosine methylation is a central epigenetic modification that
    has essential roles in cellular processes including genome regulation,
    development and disease. Here we present the first genome-wide, single-base-resolution
    maps of methylated cytosines in a mammalian genome, from both human
    embryonic stem cells and fetal fibroblasts, along with comparative
    analysis of messenger RNA and small RNA components of the transcriptome,
    several histone modifications, and sites of DNA-protein interaction
    for several key regulatory factors. Widespread differences were identified
    in the composition and patterning of cytosine methylation between
    the two genomes. Nearly one-quarter of all methylation identified
    in embryonic stem cells was in a non-CG context, suggesting that
    embryonic stem cells may use different methylation mechanisms to
    affect gene regulation. Methylation in non-CG contexts showed enrichment
    in gene bodies and depletion in protein binding sites and enhancers.
    Non-CG methylation disappeared upon induced differentiation of the
    embryonic stem cells, and was restored in induced pluripotent stem
    cells. We identified hundreds of differentially methylated regions
    proximal to genes involved in pluripotency and differentiation, and
    widespread reduced methylation levels in fibroblasts associated with
    lower transcriptional activity. These reference epigenomes provide
    a foundation for future studies exploring this key epigenetic modification
    in human disease and development.},

  abstract = {DNA methylation is an important component of epigenetic modifications
    that influences the transcriptional machinery and is aberrant in
    many human diseases. Several methods have been developed to map DNA
    methylation for either limited regions or genome-wide. In particular,
    antibodies specific for methylated CpG have been successfully applied
    in genome-wide studies. However, despite the relevance of the obtained
    results, the interpretation of antibody enrichment is not trivial.
    Of greatest importance, the coupling of antibody-enriched methylated
    fragments with microarrays generates DNA methylation estimates that
    are not linearly related to the true methylation level. Here, we
    present an experimental and analytical methodology, MEDME (modeling
    experimental data with MeDIP enrichment), to obtain enhanced estimates
    that better describe the true values of DNA methylation level throughout
    the genome. We propose an experimental scenario for evaluating the
    true relationship in a high-throughput setting and a model-based
    analysis to predict the absolute and relative DNA methylation levels.
    We successfully applied this model to evaluate DNA methylation status
    of normal human melanocytes compared to a melanoma cell strain. Despite
    the low resolution typical of methods based on immunoprecipitation,
    we show that model-derived estimates of DNA methylation provide relatively
    high correlation with measured absolute and relative levels, as validated
    by bisulfite genomic DNA sequencing. Importantly, the model-derived
    DNA methylation estimates simplify the interpretation of the results
    both at single-loci and at chromosome-wide levels.},

    modification is distributed in the genomes of primary and transformed
    cells, we used an immunocapturing approach followed by DNA microarray
    analysis to generate methylation profiles of all human chromosomes
    at 80-kb resolution and for a large set of CpG islands. In primary
    cells we identified broad genomic regions of differential methylation
    with higher levels in gene-rich neighborhoods. Female and male cells
    had indistinguishable profiles for autosomes but differences on the
    X chromosome. The inactive X chromosome (Xi) was hypermethylated
    at only a subset of gene-rich regions and, unexpectedly, overall
    hypomethylated relative to its active counterpart. The chromosomal
    methylation profile of transformed cells was similar to that of primary
    cells. Nevertheless, we detected large genomic segments with hypomethylation
    in the transformed cell residing in gene-poor areas. Furthermore,
    analysis of 6,000 CpG islands showed that only a small set of promoters
    was methylated differentially, suggesting that aberrant methylation
    of CpG island promoters in malignancy might be less frequent than
    previously hypothesized.},

  abstract = {Aberrant CpG methylation is a universal epigenetic trait of cancer cell genomes. However, human cancer samples or cell lines preclude the investigation of epigenetic changes occurring early during tumour development. Here, we have used MeDIP-seq to analyse the DNA methylome of APC(Min) adenoma as a model for intestinal cancer initiation, and we present a list of more than 13,000 recurring differentially methylated regions (DMRs) characterizing intestinal adenoma of the mouse. We show that Polycomb Repressive Complex (PRC) targets are strongly enriched among hypermethylated DMRs, and several PRC2 components and DNA methyltransferases were up-regulated in adenoma. We further demonstrate by bisulfite pyrosequencing of purified cell populations that the DMR signature arises de novo in adenoma cells rather than by expansion of a pre-existing pattern in intestinal stem cells or undifferentiated crypt cells. We found that epigenetic silencing of tumour suppressors, which occurs frequently in colon cancer, was rare in adenoma. Quite strikingly, we identified a core set of DMRs, which is conserved between mouse adenoma and human colon cancer, thus possibly revealing a global panel of epigenetically modified genes for intestinal tumours. Our data allow a distinction between early conserved epigenetic alterations occurring in intestinal adenoma and late stochastic events promoting colon cancer progression, and may facilitate the selection of more specific clinical epigenetic biomarkers.},
